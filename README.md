# Tokenization

# This is Multithreaded CORE JAVA aplication.
# General flow  is like we get data file containing sequence no. and PAN number. 
# Then we have to pick each record and call APIGEE service. This is asynchronous call. 
# This would return tokenized_PAN for each sequence number. 
# Then we have to write in a new file sequence number and tokenized PAN.
